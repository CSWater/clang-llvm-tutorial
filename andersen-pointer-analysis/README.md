#  Andersen Pointer Analysis
`Pointer analysis`, or `points-to analysis`, is a static code analysis technique that establishes which pointers, or heap references, can point to which variables, or storage locations. Techniques range widely in performance and precision. Relevant algorithm is [Steensgaard's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steensgaard%27s_algorithm) and Andersen's algorithm.
